		<h1>Your Visit</h1>
		<p>It is our goal to make your visit to our office as comfortable as possible. We always begin each appointment with
			a thorough consultation explaining all of the clinical and radiographic findings, your diagnosis, and all available
			treatment options. We often set time aside to provide same day endodontic treatment (if it is confirmed to be
			indicated and necessary). However, a complex medical history or treatment plan may require an evaluation and a
			second appointment to provide treatment on another day. If you prefer to proceed with a consultation only, please
			inform us of such and we will be more than happy to accommodate your request.</p>
		<h3>Please assist us by providing the following information at the time of your consultation:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Your Referral Slip</li>
			<li>A List of Medications You Are Currently Taking</li>
			<li>If you have dental insurance, please bring the necessary completeed forms. This will allow us to help you
				process any claims.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> A parent or guardian must accompany all patients under the age of 18 at the consultation
			website.</p>

		<p>Please alert the office if you have a medical condition that may be of concern prior to treatment (i.e. diabetes,
			high blood pressure, artificial heart valves and joints, rheumatic fever, etc.), if you are on any specific
			medications that may affect bleeding (i.e. heart medications, aspirin, anticoagulant therapy, etc.), or if you
			require medication prior to dental cleanings or dental treatment (i.e antibiotics). We also recommend that your
			inform us of any need for oral sedatives or nitrous oxide <i>prior to your appointment date.</i></p>

		<h3>X-Rays/Imaging</h3>
		<p>You may request that your restorative dentist forward any relevant x-rays to our office, but this is not typically
			necessary. It is our standard of care to take any necessary radiographs at our office to aid in diagnosis and
			treatment. When indicated, we may recommend additional cone-beam CT imaging.</p>
