		<h1>Endodontic Retreatment</h1>
		<p>With the appropriate care, your teeth that have had endodontic treatment will last as long as other natural teeth.
			Yet, a tooth that has received treatment may fail to heal or pain may continue to exist. Sometimes, discomfort or
			swelling may occur months or years after treatment. If so, endodontic retreatment may be needed.
		</p>
		<h3>Improper healing may be caused by:
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Curved or narrow canals were not treated during the initial treatment.
			</li>
			<li>Complicated canals went undetected during the initial treatment.
			</li>
			<li>The crown or restoration was not placed within the appropriate amount of time following the procedure.
			</li>
			<li>The crown or restoration did not prevent saliva from contaminating the inside of the tooth.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>In some cases, new problems can influence a tooth that was successfully treated:
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>New decay can expose a root canal filling material, causing infection.
			</li>
			<li>A cracked or loose filling or crown can expose the tooth to new infection.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Once retreatment has been selected as a solution to your problem, the doctors will regain access to the root canal
			filling material. The restorative material will be removed to enable access to the root canal system. The doctors
			will then clean your canals and carefully examine the inside of the problematic tooth. Once cleaned, the doctors
			will fill and seal the canals.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>
				At this point, Dr. Saoji will discuss what additional restorative care may be necessary for the treated tooth.
