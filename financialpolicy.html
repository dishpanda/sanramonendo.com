		<h1>Financial Policy</h1>
		<h3>Patient Billing</h3>
		<p>We deliver the finest care at the most reasonable cost to our patients. It is our policy that payment is due at
			the time service is rendered, unless other arrangements have been made in advance. For your convenience we accept
			Visa, MasterCard, American Express, personal checks, and cash.</p>
		<p>We give an estimate of the treatment fee prior to your visit to our office. If you have questions regarding your
			account, please contact us at San Ramon Office Phone Number <a href="tel:9258295711">(925) 829-5711</a>. Many times,
			a simple telephone call will help to clarify any questions that you may have.</p>
		<p><b>Please remember that you are responsible for all fees charged, regardless of your insurance coverage.</b></p>
		<p>We will send you a monthly statement when applicable. Most insurance companies will respond within four to six
			weeks. Please call our office if your statement does not reflect your insurance payment within that time frame.
			Although as a courtesy to patients we may provide an estimate of your financial responsibility beyond insurance
			payment, <i>this is indeed merely an estimate</i>, and your balance due may change based upon yearly maximums and covered
			services. Any remaining balance after your insurance has paid is your responsibility. Your prompt remittance is
			appreciated. We can make arrangements for a payment plan <i>prior</i> to the actual procedure.</p>
