		<h1>Insurance Information</h1>
		<p>We make every effort to provide you with the finest care and the most convenient financial options. To accomplish
			this we work hand-in-hand with you to maximize your insurance reimbursement for covered procedures. If you have any
			problems or questions, please ask our staff. They are well informed and up-to-date. They can be reached by phone at
			the Office Phone Number <a href="tel:9258295711">(925) 829-5711</a>.</p>
		<p>Please call if you have any questions or concerns regarding your initial visit.</p>
		<p>Please bring your insurance information with you to your appointment so that we can expedite reimbursement.</p>
		<p>As a service to our patients, our practice accepts most dental insurance programs, including non-managed care,
			indemnity (traditional) and PPO out-of-network. We do not participate in any HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT plans. However,
			we will be happy to file your insurance claims for you. Our office will prepare all the necessary forms for your
			dental benefits. Please feel free to contact our office to verify acceptance of your plan.</p>
		<p>We do remind you however, that your specific policy is an agreement between you and your insurance company. Please
			keep in mind that you are responsible for your total obligation should your insurance benefits result in less
			coverage than anticipated. Our office will gladly submit a pre-treatment estimate to your insurance company so that
			you will know what your benefits will be and we will do all we can to help maximize your insurance benefits.</p>
		<p>The fees charged for services rendered to those who are insured are the usual and customary fees charged to all
			our patients for similar services. Your policy may base its allowances on a fixed fee schedule, which may not
			coincide with our usual fees. You should be aware that different insurance companies vary greatly in the types of
			coverage available. Also, some companies take care of claims promptly while others delay payment for several months.</p>
