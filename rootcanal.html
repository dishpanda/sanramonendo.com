		<h1>Root Canal Therapy</h1>
		<h3>What is a root canal procedure?
		</h3>
		<p>Root canal therapy is one of the most common dental procedures performed, well over 14 million every year. When
			indicated, this treatment can help to save your natural teeth and prevent the need of dental implants or bridges.
		</p>
		<p>At the center of your tooth is pulp. Pulp is a collection of blood vessels that helps to build the surrounding
			tooth. Irritation of the pulp can be caused by trauma to the tooth, deep decay, cracks and chips, or repeated dental
			procedures. Associated symptoms may be cold or heat sensitivity, pain to biting or tapping, spontaneous pain, or
			swelling of the face or adjacent gum tissue.
		</p>
		<p>If you experience any of these symptoms, your dentist will most likely recommend non-surgical root canal treatment
			to eliminate the diseased pulp. This injured pulp is removed and the root canal system is thoroughly cleaned and
			sealed. This therapy usually involves local anesthesia and may be completed in one or more visits depending on the
			treatment required. Success for this type of treatment occurs in well over 90% of cases. If your tooth is not
			amenable to endodontic treatment or the likelihood of success is unfavorable, you will be informed at the time of
			consultation. We use local anesthesia to allow for a predictable, comfortable procedure. In addition, we will
			provide nitrous oxide analgesia if indicated and requested. You will be able to drive home after your treatment, and
			will be comfortable returning to your normal routine.
		</p>
		<h3>What happens after treatment?
		</h3>
		<p>When your root canal therapy has been completed, a record of your treatment will be sent to your restorative
			dentist. If it is necessary, Dr. Saoji will discuss whether you may need to contact the office
			of your restorative dentist for a follow-up restoration within a few weeks of completion at our office. Your
			restorative dentist will decide on what type of restoration is necessary to protect your tooth. It is rare for
			endodontic patients to experience complications after routine endodontic treatment or microsurgery. If discomfort or
			questions occur we can be contacted during and after office hours. To prevent further decay, continue to practice
			good dental hygiene.
		</p>
		<h3>How much will it cost?
		</h3>
		<p>The cost associated with this procedure can vary depending on factors such as the complexity of treatment that is
			required and which tooth is affected. In general, endodontic treatment is much less expensive than tooth removal and
			replacement with an artificial tooth.
